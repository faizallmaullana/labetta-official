                    talking both about sorrow and happiness,<br>
                    full of its surprising moment,<br>
                    from moment of silence till moment of truth,<br>
                    its the interpretation of every moment be it the one thats long gone but worth to keep,<br>
                    or the one that still exists. This book is divided into 4 big parts,<br>
                    1. Special journey of life;<br>
                    2. Love;<br>
